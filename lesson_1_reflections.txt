How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    compare to see what was changed from the version that worked

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    will save you time when you make mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you don't want too many/little commits, it's hard to find the bug

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it can involve multiple files to complete a task. Googod docs are usually not related to each other. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see details of each commits, git diff to compare the difference made between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    can always revert when things break

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
